fm2dstt5.f90:
test to see how sparsity related to smoothness, no sparsity first
fm2dstt5_test.f90
sparsity constrain, only to the model variation
fm2dstt6.f90
fm2dstt5_test.f90 with scaling
fm2dstt7.f90
add ray geometry to file
fm2dstt8.f90
add openmp
fm2dstt8_2.f90
a little change,seems bug
fm2dstt9.f90
add weight to the data residual
fm2dstt10.f90
l1 norm minimization to decrease the outlier effect
the result seems not so good
fm2dstt10_2.f90
change to another verison, incorporate the regularization term into the misfit term
fm2dstt10_3.f90
add the scaling relationship of Vp and rho into the sensitivity matrix
fm2dstt10_4.f90
probably a bug in the weight matrix of IRLS, use sqrt to the weight
fm2dstt11.f90
fm2dstt8.f90 without scaling,the result seems good compared to the one with scaling, with smaller weight...
fm2dstt11_2.f90
add the scaling relationship of Vp and rho into the sensitivity matrix

SurfTomo3.2
new format of input file like joint inversion code
#remember to renew the format again in a format that computing the traveltime for one source and then get the raypath for all receivers, this will save some time since computing the travel time field every time is unnecessary
